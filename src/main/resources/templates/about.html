                    <h3>How do recommender systems works?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Recommender systems use algorithms to analyze user data, such as browsing history, purchase history, ratings, and reviews,
                        to identify patterns and make personalized recommendations. There are different types of recommender systems, including content-based,
                        collaborative filtering, and hybrid approaches.
